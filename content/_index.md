# Andrew Jonelis

**Assistant Teaching Professor of Economics**  
Syracuse University

I am an economist specializing in development economics and African political economy. My research examines how political institutions shape economic outcomes, with particular focus on regional favoritism, executive turnover, and the relationship between political structures and growth.

Before joining Syracuse, I worked as a Research Analyst and PhD Intern at the International Monetary Fund, where I contributed to policy research on informal economies and productivity growth in developing countries.

I teach courses in macroeconomics and development economics, including Introductory and Intermediate Macroeconomics and Economics of Emerging Markets.
